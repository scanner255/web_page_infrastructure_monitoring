# Web Page Infrastructure Monitoring with MongoDB
This python script is a built from scratch script which monitors system health (CPU, Mem, Disk Usage), FTP, DNS, & SSH of your custom website.
The logs are stored in a MongoDB collection allowing for troubleshooting if any system is down. This script can be combined with Cron Jobs, in order to have 
constant monitoring of the website.
